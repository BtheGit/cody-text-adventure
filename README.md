# Choose Your Own Adventure Framework

## A Teaching Exercise

This framework and example story were created in concert with a junior high school student during ESL/coding classes. 
The goal was to encourage the student to create a text adventure that made use of new vocabulary from the previous week's lesson. 
In addition, this framework was created iteratively in order to demonstrate the basics of HTML, CSS, and typical programming tools, such as loops and conditionals.
